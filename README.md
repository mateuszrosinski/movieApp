  Moody Movie is an application that searches for a movie for us based on an assessment of our mood and well-being and the emotions that accompany us. 
  If we are feeling joy, the app will show us the titles of movies related to this and guide the user to where these movies can be seen. It will display a view with a list of movies and a brief description of them that could potentially interest us.
