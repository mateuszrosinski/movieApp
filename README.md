  Moody Movie is an application that searches for a movie for us based on an assessment of our mood and well-being and the emotions that accompany us. 
  If we are feeling joy, the app will show us the titles of movies related to this and guide the user to where these movies can be seen. It will display a view with a list of movies and a brief description of them that could potentially interest us.
I use React framework and Material UI library to develop the application, this is just a prototype version of the application, in the future I will add the other tools and describe them in more detail.
